## Paper & Tools

Paper on how coarse-graining reduces cognitive load and degrees of freedom, making simulations easier to run and understand while also reducing relaxation time and autocorrelation time.

- [Perspective paper on coarse-graining, cognitive load, and materials simulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025619304203)

System initialization, atom typing, force field schema and more! All with a convenient python API ‚ú®üêç‚ú®.

- [ Molecular Simulation Design Framework (MoSDeF)](https://mosdef.org/)

Tutorial on how the MoSDeF framework can be used to coarse-grain an atomistic system using [SMILES](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/index.html) strings and use [hoomd-blue](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/) to run the simulation.

Epoxy reaction methods using a hoomd plugin, enabling for the first time stochastic bonding in coarse grain epoxy systems and toolkit for screening epoxy chemistries and coarse-grain model model generation.

Need a tool that can manage thousands of simulations/state points and support arbitrary workflows? Then you need the Signac framework!

## Poster Design 

Like the way the poster looks? Me too! I've linked below a youtube video that explains the design methodology and there is a template in the description of the youtube video.
