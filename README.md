## Paper & Tools

Paper on how coarse-graining reduces cognitive load and degrees of freedom, making simulations easier to run and understand while also reducing relaxation time and autocorrelation time.

## Poster Design 

Like the way the poster looks? Me too! I've linked below a youtube video that explains the design methodology and there is a template in the description of the youtube video.
